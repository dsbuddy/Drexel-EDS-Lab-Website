                        <p><i>Data Scientist</i></p>
                        <p>Mike received a BS (2016) from Temple University in Earth and Environmental Sciences and an MS (2020) from Drexel University (DU) in Environmental Engineering, with a focus on water resources engineering and environmental modeling. He also supplemented his graduate work by obtaining a Graduate Minor from DU in Computer Science. Before joining EDS, Mike had a background in geographic information systems and remote sensing, hydrogeology and watershed modelling. His focus as a part of EDS is on integrating the increasing number of large datasets with the scientific understanding of water resources as it applies to water quality, supply, ecology, and land use dynamics. His interests include geospatial analysis and visualization, hydrologic modeling, applying machine learning algorithms to large environmental datasets, database administration, Application Program Interface (API) development, and informing targeted implementations of Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) and other Best Management Practices (BMPs).</p>

                        <h4>Barry Evans</h4>
                        <p><i>Senior Water Resource Scientist</i></p>
                        <p>Dr. Barry Evans has worked for over 40 years as an environmental scientist in both the private and academic sectors specializing in map-based analysis and assessment. Early in his career, Barry worked for a number of small private environmental/engineering firms, and was a co-founder of a leading GIS consulting firm called Geo Decisions which continues to be a leader in the geospatial analysis field today. From 1995-2018, Dr. Evans was associated with the Penn State Institutes of Energy and the Environment (PSIEE) where he developed numerous GIS-based modeling applications and led research teams involved in a wide variety of water resource-oriented projects related to watershed modeling, TMDL assessment, groundwater vulnerability, drinking water protection, and the evaluation of pollution mitigation strategies at the watershed level. Two major applied research efforts that he led there include the development of the GIS-based water quality modeling tools called AVGWLF and MapShed (see <a href="http://www.mapshed.psu.edu">www.mapshed.psu.edu</a>).</p>
                        <p>Dr. Evans retired from Penn State in May of 2018, and worked as an Adjunct Scientist at the Stroud Water Research Center (see <a href="http://www.stroudcenter.org">www.stroudcenter.org</a>) starting September of 2012. At Stroud, he was one of the lead developers of a web-based, national-scale watershed modeling tool called Model My Watershed (see <a href="http://www.wikiwatershed.org">www.wikiwatershed.org</a> ) that has recently received national acclaim for its’ various innovations (see <a href="https://stroudcenter.org/press/watershed-model-amazon-challenge-winner/">stroudcenter.org/press/watershed-model-amazon-challenge-winner/</a>). Beginning in early 2019, he started working on a part-time basis as a Senior Water Resource Scientist at the Academy of Natural Sciences (ANS), which is now affiliated with Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA (see <a href="http://www.ansp.org/research/">www.ansp.org/research</a>). One of the principal projects that he has been involved in with other ANS faculty has been the development of the Stream Reach Assessment Tool (see <a href="https://www.streamreachtools.org/">www.streamreachtools.org</a>) that was created to support a major watershed restoration effort being funded by the William Penn Foundation in the Delaware River Basin. Other recent projects have included various water quality impact assessments completed as part of the Delaware River Watershed Initiative (<a href="https://4states1source.org/">4states1source.org</a>).</p>
                        <p>In addition to the activities outlined above, Dr. Evans has also participated in a number of international projects in the Mideast, Europe, and across Latin America that were supported by such diverse organizations as the Amazon Center for Environmental Education and Research, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute, the Mexican Institute of Water Technology, the National Water Commission of Israel, the Argentine Institute of Oceanography, the Environment Agency of England and Wales, The Joint Research Commission of the European Union, and the Republic of Colombia. As a result of his extensive travels throughout Latin America, Dr. Evans has developed a working proficiency with Spanish.</p>
                        <p>Barry received a B.S. degree in Natural Resources from the Ohio State University, a Master’s degree in Environmental Pollution Control from Penn State University, and a Ph.D. in Soil Science from Penn State University.</p>
